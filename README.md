# Kenya_Loan_Default_ML
We predict loan defaults using 68K+ Kenyan microfinance records merged with monthly economic indicators. After cleaning and feature engineering, we apply logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting to identify key risk drivers and evaluate how economic conditions influence borrower behavior.
